                <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p> A broad category involving any and all service types falling under the cybersecurity.  
                    In IT, it’s the act of protecting networks and data from malicious attacks by deploying a variety of methods, 
                    from network monitoring, firewalls, anti-virus, layered networks, and more. Often managed through a provider, 
                    it can also be handled on-site. Cybersecurity services are valuable as they draw from larger resources and more 
                    experienced staff.</p>

                <h2>Printing Service</h2>
                <p> Printing IT services includes all services associated with the management, recording, and printing of documentation. 
                    Normally handled by a business in-house, but in rare cases where additional help is required, a third party can manage 
                    high volumes of printing requests, maintain backups of documentation, and organize said documentation in virtual 
                    spreadsheets.</p>

                <h2>Anti-virus Protection</h2>
                <p> A subset of cybersecurity, anti-virus services are perhaps one of the most common types of IT service , anti-malware protection 
                    comes in the form of software and/or monitoring. Because of the evolving threat malware presents in the modern world, any company 
                    relying on IT must have some form of anti-virus installed or service used.</p>
